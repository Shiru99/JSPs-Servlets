	<h2>Request, Session & Context </h2>
	
	<h3>Request scope</h3>
	<p>Request scope start from the moment an HTTP request hits a servlet in our web container and end when the servlet is done with delivering the HTTP response.</p>
	
	<h3>Session scope</h3>
	<p>A session scope starts when a client (e.g. browser window) establishes connection with our web application till the point where the browser window is closed. Session scope spans across multiple requests from the same client.</p>
	
	<h3>ServletConfig</h3>
	<p>ServletConfig is an object containing some initial parameters or configuration information
	 created by Servlet Container and passed to the servlet during initialization.
	 ServletConfig is servlet specific - Each servlet has got its own ServletConfig object.
	  (Note - ServletContext is for whole application)</p>
	
	<h3>Application or context scope</h3>
	<p>Context scope starts from the point where a web application is put into service (started) till it is removed from service (shutdown) or the web application is reloaded. Parameters/attributes within the application scope will be available to all requests and sessions.</p>
