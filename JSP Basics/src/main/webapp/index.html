	<h2>Basics of JSPs</</h2>
	
	<h3>JSP - Java Servlet Pages</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>JSP is a technology for developing webpages that supports dynamic content. 
		This helps developers insert java code in HTML pages by making use of special JSP tags,
		 most of which start with <% and end with %></li>
		<li> When you request a .jsp file in a suitable way, the JSP file is automatically
		 translated into a proper Java servlet, compiled, and if successful, loaded into the
		  servlet engine and “run” by performing a method call into the servlet class. </li>
  		
	</ul>
	
	<h3>How JSP works</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Web server recognizes that the HTTP request is for a JSP page and
		 forwards it to a JSP engine <i>(http://localhost:8989/JSP_Basics/One.jsp)</i></li>
		<li> The JSP engine loads the JSP page from disk and converts it into a servlet content.
		 This conversion is very simple in which all template text is converted to println() statements
		  and all JSP elements are converted to Java code. This code implements the corresponding
		   dynamic behavior of the page.</li>
  		<li> The JSP engine compiles the servlet into an executable class and
  		 forwards the original request to a servlet engine. </li>
  		<li> The web server forwards the HTTP response to your browser in terms
  		 of static HTML content. </li>
  		 <li>web browser handles the dynamically-generated HTML page inside the HTTP response
  		  exactly as if it were a static page.</li>
	</ul>
