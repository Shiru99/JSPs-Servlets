	<h2>Servlets - Life Cycle</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Servlet is normally created when a user first invokes a URL corresponding to the servlet</li>
		<li>The servlet is initialized by calling the init() method.</li>
		<li>The servlet calls service() method to process a client's request.</li>
		<li>The servlet is terminated by calling the destroy() method.</li>
		<li>Finally, servlet is garbage collected by the garbage collector of the JVM.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>init() Method</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The servlet container calls the init method exactly once after instantiating the servlet.
		 The init method must complete successfully before the servlet can receive any requests.</li>
		<li>When a user invokes a servlet, a single instance of each servlet gets created,
		 with each user request resulting in a new thread</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>service() Method</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The servlet container (i.e. web server) calls the service() method to handle requests
		 coming from the client( browsers) and to write the formatted response back to the client.</li>
		<li>Each time the server receives a request for a servlet, the server spawns a new thread
		 and calls service. The service() method checks the HTTP request type and calls methods
		  as appropriate.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>destroy() Method</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The destroy() method is called only once at the end of the life cycle of a servlet.
		 And it will not call the service method again on this servlet.</li>
		<li>This method gives the servlet an opportunity to clean up any resources that are 
		being held (for example, memory, file handles, threads).</li>
	</ul>
