# MVC Application

### MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller Pattern)

* Model - The Model contains only the pure application data, it contains no logic describing how to present the data to a user
* View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.
* Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.
